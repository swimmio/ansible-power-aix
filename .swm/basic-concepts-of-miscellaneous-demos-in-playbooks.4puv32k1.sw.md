# Overview of Miscellaneous Demos

Miscellaneous Demos in Playbooks provide various examples of how to use different modules and functionalities available in the IBM Power Systems AIX Collection. These demos include tasks such as performing BOSBOOT operations, gathering system configuration values, installing packages using dnf, managing alternate disk copies, and handling interim fixes with emgr.

# Purpose of Miscellaneous Demos

Each demo playbook is designed to showcase specific use cases and configurations, helping users understand how to implement and automate these tasks on AIX systems.

# Examples of Miscellaneous Demos

For instance, the <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_bosboot.yml](playbooks/demo_bosboot.yml)</SwmPath> playbook demonstrates how to verify, create, and manage boot images, while the <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_getconf.yml](playbooks/demo_getconf.yml)</SwmPath> playbook illustrates how to retrieve various system configuration values. Similarly, the <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_dnf.yml](playbooks/demo_dnf.yml)</SwmPath> playbook shows how to install packages using the dnf module, and the <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_suma.yml](playbooks/demo_suma.yml)</SwmPath> playbook provides an example of managing system updates using SUMA.

# Detailed Example: BOSBOOT Operations

The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_bosboot.yml](playbooks/demo_bosboot.yml)</SwmPath> playbook is a practical guide for performing BOSBOOT operations. It includes tasks to verify, create, and manage boot images on AIX systems. This playbook helps users ensure that their systems can boot correctly after updates or changes.

# Detailed Example: Gathering System Configuration Values

The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_getconf.yml](playbooks/demo_getconf.yml)</SwmPath> playbook demonstrates how to retrieve various system configuration values. This is useful for auditing and monitoring system settings to ensure they meet organizational standards.

# Detailed Example: Installing Packages Using DNF

The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_dnf.yml](playbooks/demo_dnf.yml)</SwmPath> playbook shows how to install packages using the dnf module. This playbook is essential for managing software installations and updates on AIX systems, ensuring that all necessary packages are installed and up-to-date.

# Detailed Example: Managing System Updates with SUMA

The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_suma.yml](playbooks/demo_suma.yml)</SwmPath> playbook provides an example of managing system updates using SUMA. This playbook helps automate the process of downloading and applying updates, keeping AIX systems secure and up-to-date.
