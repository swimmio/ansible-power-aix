# Basic Concepts of Configuration Demos in Playbooks

Configuration Demos in Playbooks provide practical examples of how to manage and configure various aspects of AIX systems using Ansible modules. These demos include tasks such as creating, modifying, and removing entries in the inittab file, managing IPv4 tunnels, handling tunable parameters, and saving or restoring tunable configurations.

## Why Use Configuration Demos

Configuration Demos in Playbooks are essential for providing practical examples of managing and configuring various aspects of AIX systems using Ansible modules. By following these demos, users can learn how to automate complex configuration tasks, ensuring consistency and efficiency in managing AIX systems.

## How to Use Configuration Demos

Each demo playbook is designed to showcase specific functionalities of the IBM Power AIX modules, helping users understand how to implement these configurations in their own environments. By following these demos, users can learn how to automate complex configuration tasks, ensuring consistency and efficiency in managing AIX systems.

## Example Usage

This example demonstrates how to use the <SwmToken path="playbooks/demo_tunables.yml" pos="116:8:8" line-data="        # then use: restricted_tunables: true">`restricted_tunables`</SwmToken> parameter in a demo playbook to manage tunable parameters.

The <SwmToken path="playbooks/demo_tunables.yml" pos="116:8:8" line-data="        # then use: restricted_tunables: true">`restricted_tunables`</SwmToken> parameter is used in the demo playbook to manage tunable parameters.

```yaml
        # then use: restricted_tunables: true
```
