# Overview of LVM Demos in Playbooks

LVM Demos in Playbooks showcase various tasks related to Logical Volume Management (LVM) on AIX systems. These tasks include creating, extending, and removing volume groups and logical volumes.

# Usage in Playbooks

The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_lvg.yml](playbooks/demo_lvg.yml)</SwmPath> playbook demonstrates how to create scalable volume groups with mirror pools, add multiple physical volumes to a volume group, extend a volume group, and varyon/varyoff volume groups. The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_lvm_facts.yml](playbooks/demo_lvm_facts.yml)</SwmPath> playbook focuses on gathering LVM-related information, such as volume group (VG), logical volume (LV), and physical volume (PV) facts, and updating existing LVM facts. The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_lvol.yml](playbooks/demo_lvol.yml)</SwmPath> playbook illustrates the creation of logical volumes with various configurations, including specifying size, placement policies, and mirror pools. It also covers extending, renaming, and removing logical volumes.

## <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_lvol.yml](playbooks/demo_lvol.yml)</SwmPath>

The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_lvol.yml](playbooks/demo_lvol.yml)</SwmPath> playbook illustrates the creation of logical volumes with various configurations, including specifying size, placement policies, and mirror pools. It also covers extending, renaming, and removing logical volumes. Tasks include creating a logical volume of a specified size, creating a logical volume with multiple disks, creating a logical volume with a minimum placement policy, creating a logical volume with extra options like mirror pools, extending a logical volume, renaming a logical volume, and removing a logical volume.
