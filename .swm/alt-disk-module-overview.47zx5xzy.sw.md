# Alt Disk Overview

Alt Disk refers to the management of an alternate root volume group (rootvg) disk. It involves copying the rootvg to an alternate disk or cleaning up an existing one on a logical partition (LPAR).

# Operations on Alt Disk

The alternate disk can be used for various operations such as copying the rootvg, cleaning up an existing alternate disk copy, or installing filesets and fixes on an existing alternate disk. The module provides options to specify the target disks, choose a disk based on size policy, and perform actions like copying, cleaning, or installing on the alternate disk.

# Ensuring Validity

The <SwmToken path="plugins/modules/alt_disk.py" pos="145:1:1" line-data="  alt_disk:">`alt_disk`</SwmToken> module ensures that the rootvg is properly checked, and valid alternate disks are found and validated before performing the operations. This ensures that the operations are performed on the correct and intended disks.

# Configuration Options

The module also includes options to handle specific configurations such as running bootlist after the copy, copying specific files, resetting device configurations, and running customization scripts during the initial boot of the alternate rootvg.
