# Plugins Overview

Plugins are components that extend the functionality of the ansible-power-aix collection. They are used to manage configurations and deployments of Power AIX systems. The plugins directory contains subdirectories for modules and actions.

## Modules

Modules in the <SwmPath>[plugins/modules/](plugins/modules/)</SwmPath> directory define tasks that can be executed on AIX systems. These tasks can include operations such as managing users, installing software, and configuring system settings. Modules are the building blocks of Ansible playbooks and are essential for automating tasks on AIX systems.

## Actions

The <SwmPath>[plugins/action/](plugins/action/)</SwmPath> directory contains custom action plugins that can modify the behavior of Ansible tasks. These action plugins can be used to implement complex logic, handle task execution flow, and extend the capabilities of existing modules. They provide a way to customize and enhance the automation process in Ansible.

## Unit Tests for Plugins

Unit tests for these plugins are located in the <SwmPath>[tests/unit/plugins/](tests/unit/plugins/)</SwmPath> directory. These tests ensure that the plugins function correctly and help maintain the reliability of the ansible-power-aix collection.

## Example of Plugin Usage

Modules in the <SwmPath>[plugins/modules/](plugins/modules/)</SwmPath> directory define tasks that can be executed on AIX systems. For example, a module can be used to manage users, install software, or configure system settings. These modules are essential for automating tasks on AIX systems.
