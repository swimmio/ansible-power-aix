title: Understanding Security Demos in Playbooks
---
# Overview of Security Demos

Security Demos showcase various security-related tasks that can be automated using Ansible modules for IBM Power Systems AIX. These demos are essential for understanding how to implement and manage security features on AIX systems using Ansible.

# How to Use Security Demos

Security Demos are used by running specific playbooks that demonstrate tasks such as managing PKS, converting volumes to encrypted states, displaying encryption status, and managing security settings. Each playbook is designed to showcase a particular aspect of security management on AIX systems.

# Examples of Security Demos

The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_hdcrypt_pks.yml](playbooks/demo_hdcrypt_pks.yml)</SwmPath> playbook demonstrates how to manage PKS (Public Key Security) on AIX systems. It includes tasks for adding PKS to a filesystem, displaying PKS key status, exporting and importing PKS keys, and cleaning invalid PKS keys. The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_hdcrypt_conv.yml](playbooks/demo_hdcrypt_conv.yml)</SwmPath> playbook focuses on converting logical volumes (<SwmToken path="playbooks/demo_hdcrypt_conv.yml" pos="24:13:13" line-data="    - name: &quot;Encrypt all the LVs present in a VG&quot;">`LVs`</SwmToken>) and physical volumes (<SwmToken path="playbooks/demo_hdcrypt_conv.yml" pos="54:10:10" line-data="    - name: Encrypt multiple PVs">`PVs`</SwmToken>) to encrypted and unencrypted states. The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_hdcrypt_facts.yml](playbooks/demo_hdcrypt_facts.yml)</SwmPath> playbook is used to display encryption status information. The <SwmPath>[playbooks/demo_chsec.yml](playbooks/demo_chsec.yml)</SwmPath> playbook demonstrates how to manage security settings on AIX systems.
